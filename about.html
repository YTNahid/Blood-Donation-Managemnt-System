      <h1>About IUS Blood Donation</h1>
      <p>Connecting lives, one drop at a time.</p>

      <h1>Our Mission</h1>
      <p>At [Your Website Name], our mission is to build a community-driven platform that connects individuals in need of blood with selfless donors in real-time. We believe that no one should lose a loved one due to a lack of blood donors.</p>

      <h1>Why We Exist</h1>
      <p>Every year, thousands of people struggle to find timely blood donations. With growing urbanization and scattered donor networks, finding a reliable match has become increasingly difficult. We created this platform to:

        Bridge the gap between donors and recipients
        
        Promote voluntary, safe, and accessible blood donation
        
        Empower communities to respond faster in emergencies</p>
